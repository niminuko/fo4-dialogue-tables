    "As mentioned in the beginning, the character Cait had been selected for this Jupyter notebook, but any character from the list of Fallout 4 characters should suffice, provided that the character actually has dialogue in-game and that the source page contains said in-game dialogue. This Notebook serves to illustrate the transformation of a full dialogue table of a Fallout 4 character from the associated website into a `pandas` DataFrame. \n",

    "Ultimately, this entire Jupyter Notebook may be reduced to a Python script to be utilized in a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project. It is through a DataFrame of character dialogue that a library such as `nltk` or `spaCy` may train on and learn about characters and content related to the Fallout universe."
