# Fallout  4 Webscraping: Characters and Dialogue

This repository includes two Jupyter notebooks and one Python script. The notebook `cait_dialogue.ipynb` uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` and showcases how the functions and structure of `generate_dialogue_table.py` came into being. If at any point the user is confused or lost when following the aforementioned `.py` script, consult the `cait_dialogue.ipynb` notebook. The second notebook `character_table.ipynb` uses `requests_html` to concisely webscrape every Fallout 4 character that has considerable dialogue (that is, dialogue important enough to earn itself an associated `.txt` file) and place that information into a DataFrame and readable file.

## Generating a dialogue DataFrame

There are a few dialogue DataFrames already present: `cait_dialogue.csv`, `darla_dialogue.csv`, and `nick_valentine_dialogue.csv`. To create a new DataFrame, enter a virtual environtment and pass a system argument with a single character's name. For example, the DataFrame for Darla's dialogue is created by `$ python generate_dialogue_table.py Darla`; the DataFrame for Nick Valentine's dialogue is generated by `$ python generate_dialogue_table.py "Nick Valentine"`. The script is written such that only the first system argument `sys.argv[1]` is accepted and there is also virtually no error handling. Feel free to improve that area!

Note that if no system argument is passed, the script defaults to selecting Cait.

## Available Characters

The supported characters for dialogue DataFrames may be found in `character_names.csv` or re-generated with the `character_table.ipynb`.
